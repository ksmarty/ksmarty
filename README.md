## About me 

I am a hardworking and dedicated university student who loves computers in their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, problem solve, and express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as coding. I am self-taught in Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Premiere Pro, InDesign, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Microsoft Office Suite. Formally, I've learnt Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I decompress by cooking, woodworking, and cycling. I also love to travel around the world and experience different cultures.

## Experience

### University Co-op Placement

⌚ Jan 2021 - Present

 📍 Sanofi Pasteur, Toronto

I am currently interning at Sanofi Pastuer, a global leader in vaccine manufacturing. As a member of the Quality Control, Data Logistics and Support department, I am assisting my team in modernizing internal tools and improving workflows for maximum efficiency.

### Highschool Co-op Placement

⌚ Feb 2018 - May 2018

 📍 Grip Limited, Toronto

I had a four month co-op placement at a mid-sized advertising agency. During this time, I worked in both the technology and video production departments. I was able to code and develop a tool that would be used internally by the marking department to ingest vendor spreadsheets. This experience provided me with a better understanding of corporate structure and how a business functions.

### Minecraft Instructor

⌚ Sep 2019 - June 2020

 📍 Robbins Hebrew Academy, Toronto

I taught Minecraft to a group of fifteen elementary-age students in a weekly after-school program. In addition, I prepared lesson plans to demonstrate different aspects of the game and develop non-digital, transferrable skills for the students.

### Senior Camp Counsellor

⌚ Summers 2016 - 2019

 📍 Camp Green Acres, Markham

I worked as a staff member with young children ranging from 5 to 8 years of age in a fun, challenging, and supportive environment. In my second and third summers I was given the additional responsibility of being a bus captain; overseeing 3 staff members. This leadership experience afforded me the opportunity to understand team management and collaboration.

### Computer Programming Team

⌚ Oct 2016 - June 2017

 📍 William Lyon Mackenzie CI, North York

I led a group of my peers in our school's coding competitions. We placed top 5 in multiple events. In addition, I was selected to be a coach for the visiting grade 7 & 8 students when they participated in our annual Science & Engineering Olympics.

---

### President of Accounting & Finance Club

## My Projects

## Goals

### 1. Be More Professional

Earlier in the year, I set a goal for myself to use only formal language and to cut coloquialisms from emails. Since setting that goal, other members of my team have taken notice and complimented me on the improvement.

### 2. Understand The Database

For my first project in my co-op placement, I was tasked with understanding and mapping out a database that was used internally. Although not a complete understanding, I have a much greater grasp of how different members of the team utilize it. With this knowledge I can begin to steamline workflows and reduce that amount of work for the team.
