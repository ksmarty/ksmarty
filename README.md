# Hi, I'm Kyle üñ•Ô∏è 
Web Developer | Software Engineer

## About me 

I am a hard working and dedicated software developer who loves computers in their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, solve problems, and express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as coding. I am self-taught in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and the Microsoft Office suite. Formally, I've learned Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I decompress by cooking, 3D printing & CAD, and working out. I also love travelling around the world and experiencing different cultures.
