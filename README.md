# Hi, I'm Kyle üñ•Ô∏è / üç≥
Web Developer | Software Engineer | Chef

## About me 

I am a hard working and dedicated university student who loves computers in their entirety. Computers allow me to be creative, solve problems, and express myself in many facets including graphic and web design as well as coding. I am self-taught in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and Microsoft Office Suite. Formally, I've learned Java, Adobe Animate, Android Development, and Turing. In my spare time, I decompress by cooking, woodworking, and rowing. I also love to travel around the world and experience different cultures.
